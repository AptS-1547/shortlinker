## Design Philosophy

### Minimalism
Focus on the core functionality of short link redirection with simple configuration and fast deployment

### High Performance
Native Rust performance guarantee, SQLite provides production-grade database performance, asynchronous concurrent processing

### Easy to Use
Command line tool management, environment variable configuration, one-click Docker deployment

## Core Features

- **Multiple Storage Backends**: SQLite database (default), JSON file storage, Sled embedded database
- **Admin API**: HTTP API management interface with authentication and custom route prefix support
- **Health Monitoring**: Complete health check API with storage status and runtime monitoring
- **Smart Expiration**: Supports flexible time format settings, automatic expiration and cleanup
- **Cross-platform Support**: Windows, Linux, macOS, smart process locking to prevent duplicate startup
- **Container Optimization**: Docker image deployment with container restart detection support

## Quick Experience

```bash
# One-click Docker startup
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 e1saps/shortlinker

# Add short link
./shortlinker add github https://github.com

# Access short link
curl -L http://localhost:8080/github
```

## Use Cases

- **Marketing Promotion**: Event links, social media sharing
- **Internal Tools**: Document redirection, system integration
- **Temporary Links**: Time-limited sharing, test environment
- **API Services**: Link management between microservices
