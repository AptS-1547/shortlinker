# Storage Configuration

Storage docs are now split into an overview plus focused pages.

## Navigation

- [Storage Backends](/en/config/storage-backends)
- [Storage Selection and Benchmarks](/en/config/storage-selection)
- [Storage Operations and Monitoring](/en/config/storage-operations)

## Basics

Shortlinker supports multiple storage backends and chooses backend type from `database.database_url`.

> 📋 Storage startup config is documented in [Configuration Guide](/en/config/).
