//! Platform abstraction layer
//!
//! This module provides a unified interface for platform-specific operations,
//! abstracting away differences between Unix/Linux and Windows platforms.
//!
//! # Key Features
//! - Signal/notification mechanisms (Unix: SIGUSR1, Windows: file-based)
//! - Lock file management (Unix: PID files, Windows: lock files)
//! - Reload mechanisms (Unix: signal-based, Windows: polling-based)
//!
//! # Architecture
//! The platform abstraction is implemented using Rust's conditional compilation:
//! - `unix.rs`: Full-featured Unix/Linux implementation
//! - `windows.rs`: Simplified Windows implementation
//!
//! Upper layers interact with platform operations through the exported functions,
//! which automatically dispatch to the correct platform implementation.
